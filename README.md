### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I have a BSc in Computer Science from 2024.
- I'm looking for a job in near Kolding (Denmark) - also available to remote work.
- I'm particularly interested in software development for the greater good.
- I like to communicate with people.
- I'm always eager to learn new stuff!
- Have a look on some of my public repositories to get insight into my interests and programming skills.
